# A Modest Module That Found Its Moment

I recently published a small Python module to PyPI and GitHub: [`db4e-systemd`](https://pypi.org/project/db4e-systemd/), a lightweight wrapper around `systemctl` that lets you control services (start, stop, enable, disable, status) directly from Python with clean, minimal code.

I wrote it to support my own `db4e` project — a full-featured deployment manager for Monero mining components — but figured the `Db4eSystemd` class might be useful on its own. It turns out I was right.

# 16 Cloners… Then 35 More?

After setting up the PyPI package and linking to my GitHub repo, I quietly pushed version `1.0.0` and moved on. A day later, I checked GitHub Insights out of curiosity: 16 unique cloners. The next day? 35 unique cloners. Without any promotion at all.

It seems there really *was* a gap in the ecosystem — one that `db4e-systemd` fills nicely.

# Why This Module Exists

Python has always had subprocess-based hacks for controlling services, but no clean, idiomatic wrapper for `systemctl` that just works and doesn’t bring in tons of dependencies. I wanted:

* A class you instantiate with a service name
* Methods like `.start()`, `.stop()`, `.restart()`, `.enable()`, `.disable()`, `.status()`
* Properties like `.active`, `.enabled`, `.installed`, `.pid`
* Clean handling of stdout/stderr

And that’s exactly what I built. One class, under 200 lines, zero dependencies beyond the standard library.

# Built for Reuse, Documented for Discovery

Once I saw people were actually cloning the repo, I cleaned up the packaging:

* Wrote a `README.md` with usage examples
* Created a `CHANGELOG.md`
* Set up a proper `setup.py` and `pyproject.toml`
* Tagged releases, pushed to PyPI, added it to my GitHub Pages KB site

I even wrote a [PyPI HOWTO guide](https://kb.osoyalce.com/pages/PyPI.html) for others who want to publish their own packages.

# Future Proofing and the 1% Idea

While `db4e-systemd` is complete for now, it plays a key role in a larger system, the [Database 4 Everything](https://db4e.osoyalce.com/), where I'm tracking uptime to implement a "1% donation model" — 5 minutes of pooled mining time for every 8 hours of uptime. That logic will likely live in this module too.

In open-source, we often think big — but sometimes the smallest tools have the biggest reach. This was a great reminder of that. I’ll definitely keep this momentum going.

If you're looking for a simple way to manage systemd services from Python, give [`db4e-systemd`](https://github.com/NadimGhaznavi/db4e-systemd) a try. And if you find it useful, drop a star — it makes a difference!
