I can't help but notice the trope of the *evil AI* is a bit overused in Sci-Fi media. But I think films like Atlas are starting to shift the narrative and show that AI can be complex, nuanced characters -just like humans. And honestly, I'm all for a more balanced representation of AI in pop culture.

And let's face it, the idea of Jennifer Lopez befriending an AI in space sounds like a pretty entertaining premise!

Two thumbs up.
