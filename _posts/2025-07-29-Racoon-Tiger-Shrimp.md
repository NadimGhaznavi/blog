This week, I introduced 15 raccoon tiger shrimp—plus a surprise 2 bonus—to my aquarium. After a proper acclimatization, I released them into the tank… and just like that, they vanished.

I caught a flash of movement as they darted out of the bag and hit the substrate, then nothing. It’s like they evaporated. But with plenty of hiding spots—moss, rocks, crevices, and driftwood—I’m hoping they’re just laying low and adjusting to their new home.

These little guys are pros at camouflage and love to tuck themselves away, especially early on. I haven’t seen them since the drop, but I’m betting they’re in there munching away on leftover fish food and biofilm like tiny, invisible janitors.

Now it’s just a waiting game. Hopefully, in the next few days or weeks, I’ll spot an antenna poking out or catch one grazing along a leaf. For now, I’m just trusting the process… and keeping my flashlight handy.
