It's been a while since I started and then abandoned this blog. My last post was in June of 2024!!

I've decided to revive the blog. Why you wonder? Well, I live in a basement apartment with my cat Felix and I'm fairly active coding and doing online courses, but I have very, very little human contact. This blog is way to assure the world, my friend and family that I'm still alive and well.

So, **Hello World!!!** :) I'm still here.
