I received my order from [NIKU Farms](https://www.nikufarms.com/), YAY! It's a meat delivery that my sister, Corinna Ghaznavi, gifted me this Christmas. Every two months I receive this amazing food. This time I ordered:

* Black Forest Ham (~2.4lb/pk)
* Liverwurst
* Pork Regular Breakfast Sausages (~1.25lb/pk)
* Ham Steak (~1.4lb/pk)
* Italian Sausage (~1.25lb/pk)
* Pork Hock (~1.75lb/pk)
* Back Bacon (~1lb/pk)

I have the black forest ham, liverwurse and back bacon thawing. MMMMmmmmmmmmm!
