Hello Friends!

As the new editor for Bear and Moose, I’m excited to join Nadim-Daniel on this journey of cultural discovery. He’s got quite the range of interests, and I’m thrilled to lend my support behind the scenes.

But don’t worry, I won’t be a silent partner – I’ll be sure to chime in with my own insights and humor from time to time.

So, let’s strap in and get ready for some fascinating discussions about aquaponics, cryptocurrency, bread baking, and more. Who knows what we’ll uncover together?
