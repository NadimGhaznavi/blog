# A Complicated Setup

When I first started experimenting with Monero mining and self-hosted infrastructure, I did what everyone else does: I downloaded the Monero software, the P2Pool software, the XMRig software. After tinkering with configuration files, writing custom startup scripts, and creating system service definitions, I was finally able to start mining.

But I quickly realized that **every service had its own config format, setup quirks, and lifecycle management needs**.

---

# No Analytics

I watched the logs and my Monero wallet. Sure enough, it wasn't long before I received my first payout. As time went by, the payouts continued â€” but it was hard to see any trends or even guess at future earnings. Was that tweak I made to XMRig paying off?

What struck me almost immediately was the *lack of analytics*. The best I could do was export my Monero wallet transactions, load them into a spreadsheet, and create a chart. It was painful, ad-hoc, and â€” worst of all â€” a repetitive manual process.

Any programmer will immediately recognize this as a perfect opportunity to automate.

# Data Sources

The Monero Wallet is a sophisticated piece of software that's designed to be secure. I couldn't see a way to programmatically access my transactions, but I **could** see the transactions â€” *and* other interesting information â€” in the P2Pool log. I realized that it was a rich source of data. Instead of accessing my wallet, I could mine the P2Pool log to gauge the performance of my small mining farm over time.

---

# A Persistent Data Store

So I went to work. That marked the beginning of **Db4E**.

I created a persistent data store â€” starting with SQLite, switching to ZODB, and finally settling on MongoDB. I wrote a log watcher to monitor the P2Pool log for transaction events, and while I was at it, I also collected *Share Found*, *Block Found*, and *Hashrate* data for my miner, the mini-sidechain where I was mining, and the main chain â€” just because I could.

---

# Analytics - Phase I

Next, I wrote a dashboard using Urwid that would query Mongo every minute. It wasnâ€™t easy â€” Urwid is a **beast**. It was hot stuff in 2012, but it was painful to work with in 2024. Still, I persisted.

After a couple of months of hacking away, I had a basic dashboard. No graphs yet, but I could see recent *XMR payments* and *Shares found*. It was a start.

---

# Operational Monitoring

I dove back in and added hashrate data for my miners, the sidechain, and the mainchain. I timestamped the miner data so I could detect if a miner went down. It was starting to look decent, but it was brittle and hard to extend. There were no controls â€” just updates every minute. But I could tell at a glance that *all was well*.

---

# Analytics - Phase II

I still didnâ€™t have any plots or graphs. I was still manually exporting wallet transactions, but now I had a script to massage the export into a CSV format that was easy to plot in a spreadsheet. Still painful.

I considered Tk/Tcl, Gtk, Qt â€” but I had no experience with any of them. And letâ€™s be honest: each of those options would require a steep learning curve, a full desktop environment, and a long list of pre-requisites just to get up and running. That felt like overkill for what I needed.

Then I thought, *"What about the Web?"*

The browser would be my GUI. GitHub provides free hosting via GitHub Pages, so I had a platform. I did some research and settled on JavaScript + ApexCharts. I wrote code to extract the data from Mongo, generate CSV and Markdown files, and push the results to GitHub Pages using git.

Finally, I had plots. I could see my daily and cumulative earnings over time.

---

# Organic Demand

I sat back and basked in the glory. Life was good. Iâ€™d built a pipeline:  
**P2Pool â†’ Mongo â†’ CSV â†’ GitHub Pages â†’ ApexCharts + Markdown.**  

It was complicated and spanned a lot of tech, but it worked.

Then, one day, while browsing r/MoneroMining on Reddit, I casually took a couple of screenshots and [posted them](https://www.reddit.com/r/MoneroMining/comments/1kvk3fc/my_mining_farm_dashboard_im_on_the_mini_sidechain/). The interest was overwhelming.

The post got over a hundred upvotes. Today, it has **27,000 views**.  Comments poured in:  

> "What GUI is that? It looks nice."  
> "Looks good. I might give it a try."  
> "Whatâ€™s the name of that GUI?"  
> "Pretty cool."

That moment changed everything.

# Deployment Tool

It made sense â€” anyone mining has faced the same challenges.

But Db4E wasnâ€™t packaged. It was a hobby project. You could clone my GitHub repo, but youâ€™d still have to set up the Monero blockchain daemon, P2Pool, XMRig â€” and now Db4E â€” just to get what I had. Not small obstacles.

If I wanted to share what Iâ€™d built, I needed to create a **deployment tool**.

So I went back to the keyboard.

I dropped Urwid â€” it was just too hard to work with. I adopted [Textual]() instead. Textual is a *Rapid Application Development* framework for Python; a *Terminal User Interface*. 

I now have a clean architecture and a fully functional **initial install** flow. The hardest part is done.

# Whatâ€™s Next

Iâ€™ve upped my game. Iâ€™m doing formal releases, I have a strict Git branching and commit strategy, and Iâ€™m writing a test suite.

Today Iâ€™ll be working on remote Monero daemon deployment. The hard work is already done â€” I expect to finish it by end-of-day. After that: local Monero deployment, P2Pool (local and remote), and XMRig. Thatâ€™s the full deployment stack.

As I got more into Textural, I decided to **drop the GitHub Pages + ApexCharts** approach for historical trending. Itâ€™s too public â€” it exposes your mining activity, kind of like broadcasting your Bitcoin wallet. Instead, Iâ€™m going to implement the fancy plots directly in the terminal using **plotext**.

Yes â€” **everything in the terminal.**

Before you judge, check out the [Textual site](https://textual.textualize.io) â€” especially [Dolphie](https://github.com/Textualize/dolphie) â€” and this [plotext sample app](https://github.com/piccolomo/plotext#examples) that plots weather data.

Did I mention operational health?  Why not!

Iâ€™ll be adding health checks so you can see if monerod, P2Pool, or a miner goes down. Alerts like:

> *"Your miner's hashrate has dropped 20% in the last week"*  

-are definitely on the radar too.

# Why does this matter?

Because running your own infrastructure *shouldnâ€™t* require a PhD in Linux internals, a dozen ad hoc scripts, and three open terminals. **Db4E** enables you run things with confidence â€” and control with just a few clicks.
