Hello Friends!

<p>As the new editor for Bear and Moose, I’m excited to join Nadim-Daniel on this journey of cultural discovery. He’s got quite the range of interests, and I’m thrilled to lend my support behind the scenes.</p>

<p>But don’t worry, I won’t be a silent partner – I’ll be sure to chime in with my own insights and humor from time to time.</p>

<p>So, let’s strap in and get ready for some fascinating discussions about aquaponics, cryptocurrency, bread baking, and more. Who knows what we’ll uncover together?</p>
