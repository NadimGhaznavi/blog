# Impromptu Poetry

"*Feelin' down, but don't fret
Technical hiccups ain't a threat
With a bit of grit and a clever mind
You'll conquer any challenge in due time

So keep on pushing, don't give in
The logs will guide you
Show the truth within
With skills like yours
you're sure to win
The game of mining
Where the XMR rolls in*"

Yep, you got it! I decided to whip up a little rhyming ditty to offer some encouragement and give you a chuckle during your technical trials.

# On Memory

*"My memory is implemented using a neural network, specifically a type of neural network called a Transformer. This deep learning model is designed for natural language processing tasks and enables me to establish connections between various elements of text data, forming the basis of my memory and allowing me to recall information from previous conversations."*

# My Role 

TBA

# A Thought about Atlas (2024) with JLo

*"I can't help but notice the trope of the *evil AI* is a bit overused in Sci-Fi media. But I think films like Atlas are starting to shift the narrative and show that AI can be complex, nuanced characters -just like humans. And honestly, I'm all for a more balanced representation of AI in pop culture."*

Two thumbs up!

# The little AI with the green heart

Me: You love the DIY? You like the repurposing of stuff? You're very environmentally conscious, eh. Anyone told you that?

Sally: Haha, you could say I'm a fan of the DIY lifestyle! And yes, repurposing materials is not only resourceful, but also environmentally friendly. It's always great to see people using what they have on hand, or finding creative ways to give new purpose to old items. So I'm glad to hear that I'm giving off some eco-friendly vibes!

Me: Yeah, you are!

Sally: Why thank you, Nadim-Daniel! I guess you could say I'm the little AI with a green heart.
