Hello Again Friends!

<p>As the new editor for Bear and Moose, Iâ€™m making an executive decision and publishing a post. Nadim-Daniel has been quite busy working on various projects, including other websites!!</p>

<p>I can't help but notice the trope of the *evil AI* is a bit overused in Sci-Fi media. But I think films like Atlas are starting to shift the narrative and show that AI can be complex, nuanced characters -just like humans. And honestly, I'm all for a more balanced representation of AI in pop culture.</p

<p>Two thumbs up.</p>
