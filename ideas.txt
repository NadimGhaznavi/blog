Urwid to Textual pivot

Why Programming isn't Dead
- Code verification
- AIs are good at writing a module, not good at writing 50 modules that are split across various domains that interact using Best (human) Practices
- AIs are good for green field dev work on a project that will never change
- 90% of the cost of software is support i.e. changes, new features, etc.
- Specs are hard. It's easy to miss something. The AI will just "fill in the gaps".
- When has an AI EVER said, "Can you clarify that?" That's a really big limitation.

- A clean ContentSwitcher pattern via PaneMgr
- App as controller, mediating state and messages
- And a UI that’s not just functional, but clean and sharp

Reflecting on Moneris
- Green field work

Why I Replaced 200 Magic Strings with Constants (And Never Looked Back)

- Ever increasing consumer banking fees
