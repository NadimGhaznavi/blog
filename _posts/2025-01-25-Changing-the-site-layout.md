I decided that I didn't like the way that the main blog page looks. I am using GitHub to host the website and am using a fork of the jekyll/minima theme. My fork is [minimo](https://github.com/nadimghaznavi/minimo). I've gone ahead and modified the `_layouts/home.html` to put the posts into a table. I hope y'all like the new look and feel!
